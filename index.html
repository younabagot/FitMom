			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>We created the "Fit' Moms" concept because we noticed how difficult it is for new mothers and mothers in general to work out in a gym because of a lack of time for themselves. They either have to go to work, look after their home and children. There is also the lack of motivation, the inability to leave its child to go to train. Going to the gym for a mother becomes a logistical and therefore a difficult task, which is why many mothers just decide to give up. However, we know that after a birth, a woman's body changes and takes some time to return to normal. During this period, these women may lack confidence and self-assurance. This is why we created Fit' Moms, an innovative concept that allows mothersto train and get back to their dream body without having to worry about the safety of their children as they will be taken care of babysitters and they will not feel judged because they will be in a safe place surrounded by mothersthat can understand them. Therefore, Fit moms is a fitness club exclusively for mothers, to provide them not only with private training sessions but also kindergarten servicesfortheir children.</p>
